A jolly old dentist from Leith,
Took pleasure in yanking out teeth.
no negligible cavities
escaped his depravities
On the top row or that underneath.

A lisping old man from Redruth
Always struggled to tell the truth.
When asked, ‘Why mendacity?’
He replied, ‘With veracity
One should always play fast and looth!’
